# Electronic Liquid Dispenser

The electronic liquid dispenser is an automatic liquid dispenser based on the well-known project by [Alex Gyver](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://alexgyver.ru/about_gyver/&ved=2ahUKEwi2q-HMqdOLAxXq9QIHHc0FFR0QFnoECCYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1rDqv2uakHtufNj98641UN) ‚Äî the "Nalivator".  
This repository was created as part of my diploma work in the specialty **"[Maintenance and Repair of Radio-Electronic Equipment](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=http://ttiip.ru/technik_2110202.html&ved=2ahUKEwibq_acqdOLAxUN-AIHHZ_fA44QFnoECB0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1QHKlo13XkNP1YWU1fiTzu)"** at the **[Tiraspol College of Informatics and Law](https://ttiip.ru/index.php)**.

This project was chosen for the diploma work because it perfectly combines theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired during the learning process.  
In this repository, I share all the materials used in the development of the device, including components, 3D model of the case, wiring diagrams, and other important files.

### üìÉ Project Description

The electronic liquid dispenser is an automatic liquid dispenser that controls the process of pouring liquid into containers. The device monitors the volume of liquid dispensed and automatically stops the process when the level reaches the preset value. This prevents overfilling and optimizes liquid consumption.

The goal of this project was to create a device that automates the pouring process and ensures precise dosing, which is crucial in various industrial and household applications. The project is based on Arduino microcontrollers and liquid level sensors, enabling real-time liquid level measurement and pump control.

#### The system is designed for 1-6 shot glasses.

### üåà Shot Glass Lighting

- **Red** ‚Äì empty
- **Yellow** ‚Äì filling in progress
- **Green** ‚Äì ready for consumption

### ‚ö° Power Saving System

- A system to "ping" the power bank, preventing it from going into sleep mode.
- Thoughtful energy-saving measures:
  - The display dims when idle.
  - The servo motor disconnects from power.

### üîß Operating Modes

#### 1. **Calibration (Service Mode)**

- Power on while holding the large button.
- Wait for the **SERVICE** message.
- The encoder controls the tap position, with the angle displayed on the screen.
- The encoder button starts the pump and timer.
- Holding the large button exits the service mode and returns to normal operation.

#### 2. **Manual Mode**

- The letter **P** appears in the top left of the display.
- Place the shot glasses and press the button.
- You can add a glass during the filling cycle, and it will be filled.

#### 3. **Automatic Mode**

- Switch modes by holding the large button.
- The letter **A** appears in the top left of the display.
- Each placed glass will be automatically filled!

### ‚öôÔ∏è General Features

- If a glass is lifted before being filled, the pump stops, and the system moves to the next glass.
- If malfunctions occur (incorrect tap position, misalignment), the issue is power-related! Try adding capacitors as shown in the schematic, using a different power bank, or, ideally, testing with a standard smartphone power adapter. The system has been extensively tested, and any abnormal behavior is linked to poor power supply.

### üîã Power Maintenance

Most power banks turn off the power line when no load is detected. To prevent this, the system periodically moves the servo motor to create load spikes, keeping the power bank active.

- In this mode, the system will move the servo and flash the display every 15 seconds.
- If you do not need this feature, disable the `KEEP_POWER` setting by setting it to 0 instead of 1.

### üì¶ Included Materials

- Components
- 3D model of the case
- Connection schematics
- Other files necessary for project implementation

### üìÖ Project Information

This project was created as part of a thesis and is aimed at practical application of knowledge and skills in electronics and programming.

### üîß Key Features

- Automatic liquid dispensing with high precision.
- Manual and automatic modes.
- Adjustable liquid volume.
- Visual interface on the display (mode and volume display).
